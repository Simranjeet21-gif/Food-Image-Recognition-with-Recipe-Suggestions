# 🍴 Food-Image-Recognition-with-Recipe-Suggestions
<br>
This project is a Food Image Classification System built with TensorFlow/Keras 🤖.
It can identify different types of food 🍕🍔🍝🥚 from images.
<br><br>
📊 Model Training:
The model is trained on a curated food image dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The network learns the unique features of each food item (like shape, texture, and color), which allows it to make accurate predictions.
<br><br>
Predictions can be performed in multiple ways depending on the interface you prefer:
<br>
✅ Tested through a simple Python script 🐍
<br>
✅ Integrated with a Tkinter GUI 🖥️
