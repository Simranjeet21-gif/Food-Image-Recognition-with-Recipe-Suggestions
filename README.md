# Food-Image-Recognition-with-Recipe-Suggestions
This project is a Food Image Classification System built with TensorFlow/Keras. It can identify different types of food (such as pizza, burger, pasta, and egg) from images. The model is trained on food image datasets, and the predictions can be tested through a simple Python script or integrated with a Tkinter/Streamlit user interface.
